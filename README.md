# Netflix-Movie-Genre-Prediction
Overview:
This project aims to predict the genre of Netflix movies using machine learning techniques, based on the plot descriptions. The goal is to apply various machine learning algorithms to classify movies into one of six genres: drama, comedy, horror, action, thriller, and romance.

Purpose and Key Functionalities:
The purpose of this project is to classify Netflix movie genres using supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks. The project utilizes the plot descriptions of movies to predict their genre labels. 
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming plot descriptions into a format suitable for machine learning.

Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF to extract text features from plot descriptions.

Model Training: Training various machine learning models to predict the genre of a movie.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Presenting evaluation results through confusion matrices, performance graphs, and comparison charts.		

Steps to Run the Code
The code is in .ipynb format, you can run it in any python environment like jupyter notebook or also use google collab

Required Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
nltk
wordcloud

The dataset is from Kaggle which contains about 30k plot summary descriptions. Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots

Reproduce Results:

Ensure that the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed properly.

Use the provided scripts to train and test the models.

Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.

Performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Results will be visualized with comparison graphs and performance charts.
